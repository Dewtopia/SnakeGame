Description:
Bringing back the Nokia nostalgia with a Snake game that you used to play when you were young while you waited for your parents to finish doing something.

Features:
Full Snake game
Tap functionality for directional input
Switching View Controllers upon game end, and resetting when the Retry button is pressed.

Missing:
Would have liked to make it prettier and would have liked to add a score card.

Notes:
Xcode was surprisingly easy/friendly/familiar to use. I have extensive experience with Unity and a lot of the functionality mirrors that. Like a fun house mirror, but still a mirror.
