# SnakeGame


CSC690 Final Project

Description:
Bringing back the Nokia nostalgia with a Snake game that you used to play when you were young while you waited for your parents to finish doing something.

Notes:
Xcode was surprisingly easy/friendly/familiar to use. I have extensive experience with Unity and a lot of the functionality mirrors that. Like a fun house mirror, but still a mirror.
